A personal STM32F0 Discovery template.

Based on szczys template which can be found at https://github.com/szczys/stm32f0-discovery-basic-template .
This changes the makefile so that the file structure looks like this:

  ../

  stm32f0-discovery-basic-template/ 

  yourProjectHere/  

  ./ 

It uses szczys's folder template as a base. You can modify this as you wish.
